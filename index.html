        <p class="text">
          The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe
          changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor
          element or with a top-level document's viewport.

        Historically, detecting visibility of an element, or the relative
        visibility of two elements in relation to each other, has been a
        difficult task for which solutions have been unreliable and prone to
        causing the browser and the sites the user is accessing to become
        sluggish. As the web has matured, the need for this kind of information
        has grown. Intersection information is needed for many reasons, such as:

    </section>
    <section class="four">
      <h5 class="text">
        Implementing intersection detection in the past involved event handlers
        and loops calling methods like Element.getBoundingClientRect() to build
        up the needed information for every element affected. Since all this
        code runs on the main thread, even one of these can cause performance
        problems. When a site is loaded with these tests, things can get
        downright ugly.

      <div class="subsection">
        <p class="text">
          The Intersection Observer API lets code register a callback function
          that is executed whenever an element they wish to monitor enters or
          exits another element (or the viewport), or when the amount by which
          the two intersect changes by a requested amount.

        One thing the Intersection Observer API can't tell you: the exact number
        of pixels that overlap or specifically which ones they are; however, it
        covers the much more common use case of "If they intersect by somewhere
        around N%, I need to do something."
